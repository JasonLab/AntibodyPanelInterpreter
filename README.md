# AntibodyPanelInterpreter
Test Program for Reading Saved Antibody Panels 

So this is my extremely rough version of the program. I haven't bothered trying to optimize anything yet so it is very poorly optimized.
Some things to note/ work on (I won't be listing everything here because the list would be extremely long)
#1: Make it so that multiple panels can be accessed with the program. Though this won't be done until I fix a few things
#2: Let the user input their panel data in excel and transfer that into a usable format in python.
#3: Figure out a good way of determining if an antibody is following the pattern significantly(Especially in the cases of multiple antibodies and strangely reacting antibodies)
#4: Optimize everything and figuring out uses for loops
#5: Make it easier for users to add their own antigens. Might make a guide for non python users at some point if I can get this program running half decent
#6: Dealing with the AC results

Some things that probably won't ever get managed with this program but are on the wish list
#1: Be able to scan or photograph into excel and have the data read and processed that way including the results.
#2: Being able to assess the scores.etc of the antigram and take this into account when determining the most possible Ab
